class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var networkManager = NetworkManager()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Use weak self to avoid retain cycles
        networkManager.fetchData { [weak self] data in
            self?.updateUI(with: data)
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## UI Performance Optimization

### 1. Efficient Table Views

\`\`\`swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    // Reuse cells
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath)
    
    // Configure cell efficiently
    configureCell(cell, at: indexPath)
    
    return cell
}

private func configureCell(_ cell: UITableViewCell, at indexPath: IndexPath) {
    // Avoid complex calculations in cellForRowAt
    // Pre-calculate values when possible
    cell.textLabel?.text = precomputedData[indexPath.row]
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Image Optimization

\`\`\`swift
extension UIImage {
    func downsample(to size: CGSize, scale: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.scale) -> UIImage? {
        let imageSourceOptions = [kCGImageSourceShouldCache: false] as CFDictionary
        
        guard let data = self.pngData(),
              let imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithData(data as CFData, imageSourceOptions) else {
            return nil
        }
        
        let maxDimensionInPixels = max(size.width, size.height) * scale
        let downsampleOptions = [
            kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,
            kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately: true,
            kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,
            kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: maxDimensionInPixels
        ] as CFDictionary
        
        guard let downsampledImage = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(imageSource, 0, downsampleOptions) else {
            return nil
        }
        
        return UIImage(cgImage: downsampledImage)
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Network Performance

\`\`\`swift
class NetworkManager {
    private let session: URLSession
    private let cache = URLCache(
        memoryCapacity: 10 * 1024 * 1024,  // 10 MB
        diskCapacity: 50 * 1024 * 1024,     // 50 MB
        diskPath: nil
    )
    
    init() {
        let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
        configuration.urlCache = cache
        configuration.requestCachePolicy = .returnCacheDataElseLoad
        session = URLSession(configuration: configuration)
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Launch Time Optimization

### 1. Defer Non-Critical Work

\`\`\`swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Only essential setup here
    setupWindow()
    
    // Defer non-critical work
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.setupAnalytics()
        self.preloadData()
        self.registerForNotifications()
    }
    
    return true
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`

## Implementation

### 1. Initialize In-App Purchase

\`\`\`dart
import 'package:in_app_purchase/in_app_purchase.dart';

class IAPManager {
  static final InAppPurchase _instance = InAppPurchase.instance;
  static final Set<String> _productIds = {'premium_upgrade', 'remove_ads'};
  
  StreamSubscription<List<PurchaseDetails>>? _subscription;
  List<ProductDetails> _products = [];
  
  Future<void> initialize() async {
    final bool isAvailable = await _instance.isAvailable();
    if (!isAvailable) {
      print('In-app purchases not available');
      return;
    }
    
    // Listen to purchase updates
    _subscription = _instance.purchaseStream.listen(
      _handlePurchaseUpdate,
      onDone: _updateStreamOnDone,
      onError: _updateStreamOnError,
    );
    
    // Load products
    await _loadProducts();
  }
  
  Future<void> _loadProducts() async {
    final ProductDetailsResponse response = 
        await _instance.queryProductDetails(_productIds);
    
    if (response.error != null) {
      print('Error loading products: \${response.error}');
      return;
    }
    
    _products = response.productDetails;
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Handle Purchase Updates

\`\`\`dart
void _handlePurchaseUpdate(List<PurchaseDetails> purchaseDetailsList) {
  for (final PurchaseDetails purchaseDetails in purchaseDetailsList) {
    if (purchaseDetails.status == PurchaseStatus.pending) {
      _showPendingUI();
    } else {
      if (purchaseDetails.status == PurchaseStatus.error) {
        _handleError(purchaseDetails.error!);
      } else if (purchaseDetails.status == PurchaseStatus.purchased ||
                 purchaseDetails.status == PurchaseStatus.restored) {
        _deliverProduct(purchaseDetails);
      }
      
      if (purchaseDetails.pendingCompletePurchase) {
        await _instance.completePurchase(purchaseDetails);
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Making a Purchase

\`\`\`dart
Future<void> buyProduct(ProductDetails productDetails) async {
  final PurchaseParam purchaseParam = PurchaseParam(
    productDetails: productDetails,
  );
  
  if (_isConsumable(productDetails)) {
    await _instance.buyConsumable(purchaseParam: purchaseParam);
  } else {
    await _instance.buyNonConsumable(purchaseParam: purchaseParam);
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Restore Purchases

\`\`\`dart
Future<void> restorePurchases() async {
  try {
    await _instance.restorePurchases();
  } catch (error) {
    print('Error restoring purchases: $error');
  }
}
\`\`\`

## UI Implementation

### Product List Widget

\`\`\`dart
class ProductListWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<ProductDetails> products;
  final Function(ProductDetails) onBuyPressed;
  
  const ProductListWidget({
    required this.products,
    required this.onBuyPressed,
  });
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: products.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final product = products[index];
        return Card(
          margin: EdgeInsets.all(8),
          child: ListTile(
            title: Text(product.title),
            subtitle: Text(product.description),
            trailing: TextButton(
              onPressed: () => onBuyPressed(product),
              child: Text(product.price),
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### 1. Receipt Validation
Always validate receipts server-side for security:

\`\`\`dart
Future<bool> _verifyPurchase(PurchaseDetails purchaseDetails) async {
  // Send receipt to your server
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('https://yourserver.com/verify'),
    body: {
      'receipt': purchaseDetails.verificationData.serverVerificationData,
      'productId': purchaseDetails.productID,
    },
  );
  
  return response.statusCode == 200;
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Error Handling

\`\`\`dart
void _handleError(IAPError error) {
  switch (error.code) {
    case 'purchase_cancelled':
      // User cancelled the purchase
      break;
    case 'purchase_error':
      // Show error message to user
      _showErrorDialog(error.message);
      break;
    default:
      // Log unknown errors
      print('Unknown error: \${error.code}');
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Testing

- Use sandbox accounts for iOS testing
- Use test cards for Android testing
- Test all purchase flows including:
  - Successful purchase
  - Failed purchase
  - Cancelled purchase
  - Restore purchases

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Products Not Loading
- Ensure products are active in store console
- Check product IDs match exactly
- Wait for app review approval (iOS)

### Issue 2: Purchase Verification Fails
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Cache purchase status locally

### Issue 3: Duplicate Purchases
- Always complete purchases
- Check purchase status before delivering content
- Implement proper restore functionality

## Conclusion

Implementing in-app purchases in Flutter requires careful attention to platform-specific requirements, proper error handling, and security considerations. By following this guide and best practices, you can create a robust IAP system that provides a smooth purchasing experience for your users while protecting your digital content.

A well-structured, readable codebase helps future developers (including your future self) maintain and scale the project with ease.\n\n### Examples of Clean Code\n\n#### Swift Example (Clean vs Messy)\n```swift\n// ❌ Messy\nfunc g(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int { return a+b }\n\n// ✅ Clean\nfunc addNumbers(_ firstNumber: Int, _ secondNumber: Int) -> Int {\n    return firstNumber + secondNumber\n}\n```\n\n#### Dart Example (Clean vs Messy)\n```dart\n// ❌ Messy\nvoid p(n) {\n  print(n);\n}\n\n// ✅ Clean\nvoid printMessage(String message) {\n  print(message);\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript Example (Clean vs Messy)\n```javascript\n// ❌ Messy\nfunction c(u){return u*2;}\n\n// ✅ Clean\nfunction calculateDouble(userInput) {\n  return userInput * 2;\n}\n```\n\n### Takeaway\n✨ Optimize for **readability**, not just execution. Use clear naming, proper formatting, and avoid shortcuts that make code harder to understand.\n\n👉 Question for you: How do you ensure your code stays clean?\n",
